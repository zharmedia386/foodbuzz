# FOODBUZZ.ID: F&B Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) WhatsApp Chatbot

FoodBuzz.id is a WhatsApp bot designed to replace the role of customer service in responding to customer chats, catering to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (UMKM). The bot can be operated on the WhatsApp platform by UMKM practitioners. The bot responds to customer chats within 1-3 seconds and includes an on/off system, allowing UMKM practitioners to easily activate or deactivate the chatbot as needed. 

Additionally, this WhatsApp bot can run through the Watomatic application, integrated with a MongoDB Atlas server to automatically store customer data contacting the seller via WhatsApp and online sales data into the database. Subsequently, this data is displayed on an admin dashboard, allowing UMKM practitioners to analyze the profit and loss of their business during specific periods.

- Initial Meeting
The development of the FoodBuzz.id WhatsApp bot is driven by the needs and urgency of UMKM practitioners in running their businesses. An initial meeting is crucial to ensure that the chatbot's flow aligns with these needs and urgency, addressing the specific challenges faced by UMKM practitioners to optimize sales revenue.

- Product Discovery
After gathering information about the needs and challenges faced by UMKM practitioners, the next step is to determine the chatbot's products and the corresponding process flow. At this stage, UMKM practitioners can propose changes to the initially determined product discovery based on the chatbot's prototype.

- Prototype Creation
Once the chatbot's products and process flow are defined, the next step is to create a prototype detailing each process flow. The details include crafting responses for each message, ensuring they guide users seamlessly through the various processes, including the option for users to revert to previous steps.

- Chatbot Design
Before implementation, it's essential to design the chatbot using Figma, enabling online access for stakeholders. The design should illustrate the entire process and message responses, allowing UMKM practitioners to try the chatbot in the form of sketches and animations of the predetermined flow. This stage is also beneficial for developers during the implementation process.

- Chatbot Development
The final step involves creating the WhatsApp bot based on the designed chatbot and the previously determined prototype. The chatbot is then integrated with the MongoDB Atlas server to store customer data and sales information. Subsequently, this data is visualized on an admin dashboard accessible to UMKM practitioners for business analysis.
